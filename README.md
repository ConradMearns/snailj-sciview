# snailj-sciview
Mathematical seashell generator based on the [paper by Jorge Picado](http://www.mat.uc.pt/~picado/conchas/eng/article.pdf)

# Usage
In SciView under Demo -> Seashell, simply select a preset and click okay.
- __Turns__: Amount of rotations to generate
- __Segments per Spiral Turn__: Resolution for underlying helical shape
- __Segments per Curve__: Resolution for the "tube" that becomes the shell surface

Options __D__ to __N__ are best explained in Picado's paper, but will eventually be described here too.
